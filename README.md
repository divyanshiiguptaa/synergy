# Synergy - Spatial Infrastructure Analysis Platform

## 🎯 Product Overview

**Synergy** is an advanced spatial analysis platform designed to help city planners, infrastructure managers, and government agencies understand the relationships between capital improvement projects (CIP) and existing infrastructure assets. By leveraging geospatial data and interactive mapping, Synergy provides actionable insights for infrastructure planning and decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 **Interactive Spatial Analysis**
- **Real-time Infrastructure Matching**: Automatically identifies infrastructure assets (EV chargers, utilities, etc.) that intersect with planned capital projects
- **Multi-layer Visualization**: Toggle between different infrastructure layers to understand spatial relationships
- **Cluster Analysis**: Intelligent clustering of infrastructure points for better visualization at different zoom levels

### 🗺️ **Advanced Mapping Capabilities**
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Built on Mapbox GL JS for smooth, responsive mapping
- **Layer Management**: Dynamic layer visibility controls for different infrastructure types
- **Spatial Filtering**: Filter projects by location, date range, cost, and status

### 📈 **Data Insights & Reporting**
- **Project Impact Analysis**: Quantify how many infrastructure assets will be affected by each project
- **Contact Information Integration**: Direct access to project managers and stakeholders
- **Export Functionality**: Download analysis results for further processing

### 🎨 **User Experience**
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant design for inclusive user experience

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Frontend Stack**
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Mapbox GL JS** for high-performance mapping
- **Turf.js** for advanced geospatial analysis
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling

### **Data Processing**
- **Spatial Analysis Engine**: Custom-built algorithms for point-in-polygon analysis
- **Data Aggregation**: Intelligent grouping and counting of infrastructure matches
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of large geospatial datasets

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Vitest test suite with 100% coverage of core spatial functions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for robust code quality
- **ESLint Integration**: Automated code quality checks and formatting

## 📋 Core Functionality

### **Spatial Matching Algorithm**
The platform's core strength lies in its sophisticated spatial analysis engine:

```typescript
// Example: Finding infrastructure within project boundaries
const results = findSpatialMatches(
  cipProjects,      // Capital improvement projects
  infrastructureData, // EV chargers, utilities, etc.
  analysisConfig    // Grouping and filtering rules
);
```

### **Data Visualization**
- **Color-coded Project Areas**: Visual distinction between projects with and without infrastructure impacts
- **Interactive Popups**: Detailed project information on click
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live counts and summaries of affected infrastructure

### **Export & Integration**
- **CSV Export**: Download analysis results for external processing
- **API-Ready**: Modular architecture supports future API integration
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured for Netlify deployment with environment management

## 🎯 Target Users
